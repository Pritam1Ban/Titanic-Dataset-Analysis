This tools used in this project Excel and Python.

Following are the findings, - 

**Gender and Survival:** Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.

**Passenger Class:** First-class passengers had a higher survival rate, indicating socio-economic status played a role in survival chances.

**Embarkation Port:** The survival count varied based on the embarkation port, potentially reflecting the socio-economic distribution of passengers from these ports.

**Fare Distribution:** The majority of passengers paid lower fares, aligning with a larger number of third-class tickets.

**Fare and Survival:** Within each passenger class, there wasn't a consistent pattern to suggest that higher fares directly led to better survival chances.

**Siblings/Spouses:** Those with one sibling or spouse onboard seemed to have a slightly better survival rate than those alone or with many siblings/spouses.

**Parents/Children:** Passengers traveling alone or with one parent/child had higher survival rates compared to larger families.

**Family Size:** Solo travelers and those with a small family size (1-3 members) had better survival outcomes than larger families.

**Titles and Survival:** Certain titles extracted from names, potentially indicating social status or profession, had varied survival rates.

**Age Distribution:** Younger passengers (children) had a better survival rate, while the elderly had lower survival chances. Middle-aged individuals, especially males, formed the bulk of casualties.
